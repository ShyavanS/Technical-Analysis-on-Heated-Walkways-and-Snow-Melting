# Technical Analysis on Heated Walkways and Snow Melting

Final design project for an Engineering course at McMaster University. A group project that involved assessing the implementation of heated walkways from an economic perspective to the McMaster University Campus. My technical analysis component focused on the energy required to melt the snow.

A sensitivity analysis was also done thorugh Microsoft Excel with the culminating project demonstrating our knowledge of engineering economics.
